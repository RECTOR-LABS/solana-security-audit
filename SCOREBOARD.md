# Vulnerability Scoreboard

## Scoring Formula

```
TOTAL = SEVERITY(1-5) x POPULARITY(1-5) x EXPLOITABILITY(1-5) x PROOF_QUALITY(1-3) x FIX_SIMPLICITY(1-3)
```

Max possible: 1,125

## Selection Criteria

1. Highest total score
2. Clean, targeted fix (minimal diff)
3. Clear PoC demonstrating the exploit
4. Popular repo (stars matter for judging)
5. NOT already reported upstream

## Findings

| # | Repo | Vulnerability | Severity | Popularity | Exploitability | Proof | Fix | **Total** | Status |
